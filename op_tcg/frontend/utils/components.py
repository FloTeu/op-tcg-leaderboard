    Parameters
    ----------
    name: str
        The name of the thing we're saying hello to. The component will display
        the text "Hello, {name}!"
    key: str or None

        be re-mounted in the Streamlit frontend and lose its current state.

    -------
    int
        The number of times the component's "Click Me" button has been clicked.
